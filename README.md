## Usage

Code Context

code_context is a command-line utility designed to capture and format a project's structure and file contents into a single, clean output. It's particularly useful for pasting a project's context into Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide them with a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.

The tool intelligently finds the project root, respects .gitignore rules, and allows for powerful, reusable filtering configurations through presets.
